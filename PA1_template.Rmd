## Loading and preprocessing the data

1. Unzip the file first, if the unzipped file is not already in the working directory.  
```{r echo = TRUE}
if(!file.exists('activity.csv')){
    unzip('activity.zip')
}
```

2. Read the table.  
```{r echo = TRUE}
#read the table
activity <- read.csv("activity.csv", stringsAsFactors=FALSE, na.strings="NA")
```

3.  Update the column class to proper formats.  
```{r echo = TRUE}
#change the date column's class from string to Date
activity[,"date"] <- as.Date(activity[,"date"],format='%Y-%m-%d')
```
